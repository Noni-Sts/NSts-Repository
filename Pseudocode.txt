1. 

START
   Initialize largest_number as 0
   REPEAT
       Prompt user to enter a positive number (or 0 to stop)
       If user enters 0, exit the loop
       If user input is greater than largest_number, update largest_number
   UNTIL user enters 0
   OUTPUT largest_number
END

2. 


START
   Request the user to input their name
   Store the input in the variable first_name
   PRINT "Hello, World" followed by first_name
END

3. 

/* Arbritrary implying any random number */

START
   Set sum as = 0
   Set count as = 0
  
       Prompt user to input an integer 
       Add the input integer to sum
       Increment (add +) count by 1
	   
   Calculate average as sum / count
   
    OUTPUT average
	
   If user inputs empty input - the loop stops
  
END

4. 

START
   Start grocery_list as an empty list
   
       Prompt user to input a grocery item 
       Add the item to grocery_list
	   Sort grocery_list in alphabetical order
	   Print each item in grocery_list
	   Keep this going until the user inputs 'finish' (finish can be inputted at the beginning to prompt no list as well)
END


5. This algorithm is essentially performing a set of basic math operations based on user input.

S implies sum - A implies average and P implies product (total? of value)

START
   Prompt user to enter value for X
   Prompt user to enter value for Y
   Calculate S = X + Y     /* Sum of X and Y */
   Calculate A = S / 2     /* Average of X and Y*/
   Calculate P = X * Y     /* Product of X and Y*/
   PRINT S, A, P           /* Output the results*/
STOP
